# Design Choices for "VibeCart" Landing Page

- **Color Scheme**: I chose a vibrant pink and purple background to give the store a trendy and youthful appeal.
- **Fonts & Typography**: Used bold and modern fonts to emphasize the brand identity and product names.
- **Layout**: Implemented a clean three-section layout to keep the interface simple and navigable.
- **Responsiveness**: Added media queries to ensure the design adapts smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Navigation**: Included a sticky header with anchor links for easy navigation to different sections of the page.
